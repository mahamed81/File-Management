#File Management Project:
This is a File Management project where a user has various options. These options include seeing the files in the current directory, adding, deleting, and searching for a file in the directory. The program does not accept duplicate files, it will tell the use that they cannot add a file with the same name as a one that is already in the directory. Similarly, a user is not able to delete a file that doesnâ€™t exist in the directory. The program also ignores  the case sensitivity of the file names. Lastly, the user has the option to exit the program.
